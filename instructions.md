### Part 1: Global Styling, Navbar & Ultra-Hero Section

**Purpose:** To set the "Futuristic" tone with particles and glassmorphism.

> **Prompt (Module 1):**
> "Act as a Senior Creative Developer. Create the Global CSS and Hero Section for the ACM RBU Student Chapter website.
> **Technical Stack:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS (CDN), Google Fonts (Sora), and Lucide Icons.
> **Theme:** Light Sky Blue (#E0F2FE), Deep Navy (#0F172A), and Electric Blue (#38BDF8) accents.
> **Global Styles:** > 1. Implement a custom scrollbar (Sky Blue).
> 2. Define a Glassmorphism utility class with `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` and a semi-transparent white border.
> 3. Add a CSS-only moving mesh gradient background for the entire page.
> **The Navbar:**
> * Floating design with a glass-blur effect.
> * Logo on the left, links in the center (Home, Mission, Events, Team, FAQ).
> * 'Join Now' button on the right with a 'shimmer' animation effect.
> **The Hero Section:**
> * Create a split-screen layout.
> * Left side: A 'Typewriter' JS effect for the headline 'Advancing Computing as a Science & Profession.' Use a bold gradient text for 'ACM RBU.'
> * Right side: Create an interactive CSS/JS 'Digital Sphere'—a rotating wireframe globe or a cluster of floating nodes that react slightly to mouse movement.
> * Background: Use HTML Canvas to create a subtle 'Star-field' or 'Particles' effect that moves slowly.
> * Include a 'Scroll Down' animated mouse icon at the bottom.
> Provide only the code for this section including the `<head>` and `<body>` opening tags."

### Part 2: Mission & About Section (3D Interactivity)

**Purpose:** Moving away from flat boxes to 3D interactive cards.

> **Prompt (Module 2):**
> "Build the 'Our Mission' and 'About ACM RBU' sections for the website.
> **Our Mission:**
> 1. Create three 'Feature Cards' (Innovation, Leadership, Networking).
> 2. Use a '3D Tilt' effect using Vanilla JavaScript (on mouse move, the card tilts toward the cursor).
> 3. Each card should have a glowing icon container and a 'Glass-morphic' background that brightens on hover.
> 4. Add a subtle 'Box-Shadow' that pulses slowly to give it depth.
> **About Section:**
> 5. Use an asymmetrical grid layout.
> 6. The text should be inside a large frosted-glass container with 'About Us' in a vertical sidebar-style text on the left.
> 7. Include a 'Statistics' bar underneath (e.g., 500+ Members, 50+ Events) where the numbers count up when they scroll into view (using Intersection Observer).
> 8. Ensure typography is clean with high line-height for readability.
> Provide the HTML/CSS/JS for these two sections designed to follow Module 1."

### Part 3: The Futuristic Date-Wise Event Calendar

**Purpose:** Creating a high-tech timeline look.

> **Prompt (Module 3):**
> "Design a 'Futuristic Event Calendar' section.
> 1. Instead of a standard table, create a 'Vertical Cyber-Timeline.'
> 2. On the left: A glowing vertical line with nodes.
> 3. On the right: Event cards that slide in from the right as the user scrolls.
> 4. **Event Card Details:** >    - A 'Neon Date Badge' (e.g., '15 OCT') that glows.
> * Event Title in bold Sky Blue.
> * A 'Status' indicator (Upcoming, Live, or Completed).
> * A 'Register' button that has a 'Border-Trace' animation (a light that travels around the border on hover).
> 
> 
> 5. Add a 'Filter' toggle at the top (All, Workshops, Hackathons, Seminars) using JavaScript to hide/show cards.
> 6. Ensure the section looks clean, using whitespace effectively to maintain a 'Professional' academic feel."
>

### Part 4: The Hierarchical Team Section (The Mega-Grid)

**Purpose:** Managing 30+ members in a clean, organized, non-boring way.

> **Prompt (Module 4):**
> "Create the 'ACM RBU Team' section with a strict hierarchical row structure.
> **Row Management:**
> * **Row 1 (Lead Office Bearers):** 5 large cards for President, Vice President, Secretary, Joint Secretary, Web Operational Lead. Use a 'Gold/Silver' glowing border for these leaders.
> * **Row 2 to 5 (Technical, Event, Graphics, Publicity):** Create distinct sub-headers for each. The cards should be slightly smaller than the Lead row.
> **Card Design:**
> 
> 
> 1. Instead of simple circles, use a 'Hexagonal' or 'Squircle' (rounded square) image mask.
> 2. **Hover State:** When a user hovers over a team member, a glass overlay appears with their LinkedIn and Twitter icons sliding up from the bottom.
> 3. **The 'Bio' Pop-up:** Clicking a card should open a clean, minimal 'Glass-morphic' modal showing a short 2-line bio about the member.
> 4. Ensure the grid is responsive: 5 columns on desktop, 3 on tablet, 1 on mobile.
> 5. Use 'Staggered Fade-in' animations so the team members appear one by one as you scroll down."
>

### Part 5: FAQ, Footer, and Final Integration Logic

**Purpose:** Finishing with high-end utility and smooth transitions.

> **Prompt (Module 5):**
> "Finalize the website with the FAQ and Footer sections.
> **FAQ (Cyber-Accordion):**
> 1. Use a 'Minimalist Plus/Minus' design.
> 2. When an answer expands, use a smooth 'Spring' animation rather than a jerky drop-down.
> 3. Each question box should have a 'Left-Border Highlight' that glows when active.
> **Footer:**
> 4. A deep-navy background with a 'Wave' separator at the top.
> 5. Three columns: 'Quick Links', 'Resources', and 'Contact Info' with a 'Live Map' placeholder.
> 6. Social media icons with a 'Hover-Float' animation.
> **Final Integration:**
> 7. Add a 'Smooth Scroll' JS script for all navbar links.
> 8. Add a 'Back to Top' button that only appears after scrolling 500px.
> 9. Combine everything into a clean, minified structure that is 100% compatible with the WordPress 'Custom HTML' block.
> Ensure all assets (CSS/JS libraries) are pulled from high-speed CDNs."
